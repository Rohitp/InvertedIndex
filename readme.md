A python implementation of an inverted index.

Has two basic functions

1. Insert - POST - Inserts and indexes data. Should be a JSON object or Dict equivalent
2. Search - GET- Searches for urlencoded terms. Can use modifiers like on:text or not:title to avoid or include in search.

Work in progress.
